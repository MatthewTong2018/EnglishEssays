Henry Adams once said, “Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of Man.” Orderliness manifests itself as a means for humanity to control the uncontrollable. The unknown ranks amongst one of humanity's biggest fears, as no other species other than humans obsesses over power and the ability to control others. The short story, “Repent, Harlequin, said the Ticktockman '' by Harlan Ellison, explores a dystopian society where society functions on a clock accurate to milliseconds. With the perfectionism embedded within the plot, the story’s theme  focuses on the orderliness of society, and the dangers that it poses.

For most people, the unknown manifests anxiety and fear. With ancestral man, not knowing the location of food, predators, or their tribemates, may lead to death. Though we do not face those dangers in today’s world, important people, like Kim Jong-Un, become obsessive of people’s opinions, restricting outside information and closely monitoring people’s actions. The country of North Korea and the world within Ellison’s short story shares many common characteristics, such as an authoritarian government, and absolute control over people’s daily lives. The Master Timekeeper, better known as the TickTockman echoes the dictator in Kim Jong-Un, where both have obsession with the orderliness of society down to the millisecond. Society’s dependence on orderliness displayed itself when Harlequin, or Everett C. Marm, which “was a tiny matter, one hardly worthy of note, but in a society where the single driving force was order and unity and promptness and clocklike precision and attention to the clock, reverence of the gods of the passage of time, it was a disaster of major importance” (Ellison). Furthermore, near the conclusion of the story, Harlequin called the TickTockman a “tyrant” and stated that he had “no right to order people around and kill them if they show up late” (Ellison). The emphasis on the impact that seven minutes of delay has on society shows the over orderliness and obsession with timekeeping, going so far as to killing those who do not abide by the schedule. Being orderly and organized may benefit many, allowing them to follow a schedule so they can complete their tasks. For example, when creating plans for someone to follow, one would save time with the well organized instructions, thus adding more time to his schedule to engage in leisurely activities. Some people may enjoy the blessings of a tidy workspace, whilst others despise it, finding themselves more creative immersed in a messy environment, thinking it more organic. 

The imperfect world has order on some levels, but people wish to make their lives more so than what nature offers. Following Ellison’s theme of orderliness above all, regardless of the costs, workplaces and families more rigidly adhere to this principle, perhaps to their detriment. How many childhoods are lost due to overscheduling? How many passions were abandoned because it did not fit in the schedule? How many workers get overly stressed, relying on abuses, vices, or neglect to ease the pressure? Society needs to follow nature’s rhythms to survive, but anything above and beyond in the construct of the human mind, according to the Harlequin, proves excessive madness.
