# The Last Question by Issac Asimov
### Date added: 2022/05/5

Nobody wants to die, as mankind’s sense of self-preservation hardwired itself into our minds long ago. Thanks to this evolutionary trait, countless people throughout the years have searched for ways to become immortal, though none have succeeded.  Despite the futility of that prospect, humans still pursue the impossible in hopes of preserving one's self. When faced with a challenge that may wipe out humanity, mankind has the ability to band together abandoning all grudges and differences to face the enemy that threatens their very existence. Asimov's short story, “The Last Question,” explores how humanity may deal with the impending doom of the universe. He suggests reversing entropy as a solution, but the likelihood of that happening remains extremely slim at best.

Humans do not surpass other animals in strength, they do not possess sharp claws like tigers nor extreme bites of lions; yet, people dominate the food chain due to their collective intelligence and ability to create tools. Even though people will never get a complete understanding of everything around themselves, this will not hinder evolution. Items in daily life that serve society today may be deemed obsolete in the future, like the typewriters to the videotapes. Knowledge undergoes a similar evolution and creates obsolescence with old thought. Knowing that, one can assume the same with the understanding of science mankind has reached today.  

With Asimov’s suggestion, one needs to consider the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that “as usable energy is lost… [it] can never be reversed.” (Laws of Thermodynamics RF cafe). This unbreakable, unyielding law renders Asimov’s theory impossible... until proven otherwise. 

Of course, humanity as a species is extremely clever, so if given enough time, people of the future may discover a groundbreaking trait completely new to science we know today thereby allowing the reversal of entropy. However, even if humanity possessed enough time to engineer and understand every facet of science, the cosmos established some rules  since the beginning of time, and those cannot be broken. The end of time shall most likely happen, and physics may determine when. 
Although nobody knows any outcomes of the future, curbing the inevitable may yet lie in human capabilities, as nothing is impossible; the process may prove extremely hard, but no one should set the odds at a concrete zero. The only way to predict the future lies in the knowledge one may know and deducing the most likely possibilities, extrapolating on trends.
