Humans as a species get attached easily to companions, wealth, and status. lllogical emotions can impede rational decisions, causing a person  to break down under pressure. Machines, on the other hand, lack the capability to process emotions, resulting in an output more utilitarian than ethical. Ben Bova’s short story, “The Next Logical Step,” demonstrates how a small action can cause a domino effect impacting the outcome of a simulation. Bova’s story highlights how AI machines, unable to realize any humane limits to destruction, may employ the entire arsenal to meet its battle goals regardless of the cost. 
Ever since the popularization of the Sci-Fi genre in the 1950s, many authors, both big and small, have speculated on how machines may play a role in either the development of the human race or in its demise. Within “The Next Logical Step,” a machine simulates the outcomes of war, and instead of simply displaying them on a screen, the AI uses a method quite similar to VR, called electro encephalopathy, that allows the user to experience the real-time results in his own head. General Le Roy asks the protagonist, a CIA agent, to try the machine and watch a “situation One-Two-One [which] was a standard war game” (Bova). Instead of one side winning and another surrendering, humanity ends in an apocalyptic struggle. Within the simulation, the world-order deteriorates as nations fire nuclear weapons at each other, wiping out major cities for days on end. The simulation does not stop there, even after all the missiles, weapons, tanks, and ammunition had been used. The fighting did not end, as the narrator explains, “the machine knew better. There were still many ways to kill an enemy. Time-tested ways. There were armies fighting in four continents, armies that had marched overland, or splashed ashore from the sea, or dropped out of the skies” (Bova). Prior to the war game’s commencement, around “three billion people… lived on the planet Earth… Now, with the tenuous thread of civilization burned away, most of those who were not killed by the fighting itself succumbed inexorably to starvation” (Bova). Despite the past two world wars, humanity has survived extinction. The AI failed to comprehend human logic of when to surrender and took the war beyond human thresholds of sanity. With current technology, machines cannot replicate a human’s thinking pattern, as they lack sympathy, compassion, and emotions. Without these, a robot cannot make decisions that humans consider ethical and, ironically, logical.
Within life, sometimes defying logic may be the best logical decision no matter how counterintuitive it may come across to the human mind, such as apologizing to someone, even though the fault does not fall upon him, just to avoid ruining a friendship. Currently, robots cannot achieve such feats, and without humans to intervene, the stringent logical nature of AI may result in a less than logical result.
