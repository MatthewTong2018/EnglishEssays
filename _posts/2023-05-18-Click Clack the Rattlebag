Antoine de Saint-Expéry once said, “A goal without a plan is just a wish” Since the creation of good literature requires delicate planning and thought, the delivery of the story may either enhance the overall effect or cause the reader to lose interest. If executed properly, the author can defy the reader’s expectations of the outcomes of the story. In Neil Gaiman’s “Click Clack The Rattle Bag,” the story begins with the narrator putting his girlfriend’s little brother to bed, but as the plot progresses, the reader finds that the boy 
possesses a terrible secret that he shares with the young man by the end.  Through Gaiman’s setup and innocent plot development, the story offers an unforeseeable plot twist that satisfies the horror aficionado.  
	The barebones of every story follow an age-old, bland recipe consisting of a beginning, middle, and end. Any skillful chef, though, will add some extra special ingredients to heighten the flavor. Gaiman starts his story with a little boy asking the narrator, a young writer, to take him up to bed and tell him a story. As they discuss what stories they know, the little boy asks, “Do you know any stories about the Click-Clack the Rattlebag?” (Gaiman). The mundane setting of a two-story suburban house mixed with a nondescript small boy whose all-too-natural fear of the dark does not strike the reader as out of the ordinary, which most horror stories dwell in. Yet, Gaiman establishes the perfect neutral mood and lulls the reader to set himself up for the ultimate sucker punch in the end. 
Mystery intrigues readers and keeps them wanting more. In the story, the boy wants to hear a story about a Click-Clack, which remains an enigma to the reader until the boy explains, “...they come in when you don’t pay attention. That’s when they come in. And then they take you back to their… lair” (Gaiman). The author weaves foreshadowing into his horror story to hint at the fate of the narrator, which may or may not reach the reader. In fact, the reader may dismiss the reference to how Click-Clacks appear as simply the boy’s overactive imagination. However, as the little boy goes on to explain how Click Clacks suck the Click clack turns a person’s innards into a “milky-shakey stuff” that gets sucked out through “the holes where [a person’s] eyes used to be”, leaving a shriveled husk with your bones. From there, the Click Clacks hang the remnants, and the wind causes the husks to rattle. One may not think much of this description, as all horror stories incorporate some level of gore and it may, as stated, form itself as the product of the boy’s imagination. Gaiman utilizes this against the reader, as the description of the Click Clacks will lead the reader to believe that the child is just utilizing his imagination, never suspecting that the child poses the largest threat to the man. Gaiman’s twist on a generic horror trope of people battling some creature that threatens them, alongside with society’s preconceived notion that children’s inherent innocence, again, augments the impact of the conclusion of the story. 
A good author knows how to wrap things up in a satisfying manner. As one approaches the end of Gaiman’s story, the boy turns and asks the narrator, “Do you know what story you’re going to tell me, to put me to bed? Maybe you could tell me about this evening. Tell me what you did?” (Gaiman). The narrator explains how his girlfriend (the little boy presumably being her little brother) had moved into a new place on the edge of town, and the narrator has been waiting for “about an hour or so for her and her housemates to come back with the wine and an Indian takeaway”. Though this may seem like a child simply being curious, what he says after changes the perspective that the reader may have on the child. The boy states, “See? You know all that. But you don’t think so. You just let your brain fill in the gaps” (Gaiman). As they enter the attic, the narrator hears “things rattle gently, like dry bones in thin bags, in the slight wind. Click. Clack. Click. Clack”. The story ends with the narrator being gently pulled into the attic. At that point, iit dawns on the reader that the little boy was, in fact, a Click-Clack who also killed the narrator’s girlfriend and housemates, their bodies creating the sound that the narrator heard as he entered the attic (which also explains why they never arrived with the food). Again, this last bit does not come out of nowhere, but only after one pieces the puzzle together. Ultimately, the story proves itself a mystery prior to the crime. Gaiman builds up the plot with all of its clues and red herrings (especially how 1st person narrators scarcely die in a work, or else the reader would question who was telling the story and from where). The finale resulted from the foresight that Gaiman used to surprise his audience, and the effect worked spectacularly.

	People read books or watch movies as they can catch a glimpse of someone’s life and see how things turn out for the main character, who may or may not be similar to the reader. When the work of art defies all expectations, the work generally becomes a success. In Neil Gaiman’s “Click CLack and the Rattle Bags,” the author pleasantly surprises his readers with defiance of story procedures and formulae, a misleading of the reader with clues, the juxtaposition of expectation with preconceived notions of children, and use of first person. Life often gives many hints, some may save a person from doing something embarrassing, or allow him capitalize on a situation. However, whether he picks up on these hints will ultimately be determined by his own awareness and perspicacity.
