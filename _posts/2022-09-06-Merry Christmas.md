# Merry Christmas by Stephen Leacock
### Date added: 2022/09/6

Despite the massive differences that separate religions and societies all over the world, a god or gods unify the people of the land. Many of the popular religions today, such as Christianity and Islam, have a supreme deity within their religion, and everybody who follows said religions will worship the deity. Wherever people may be, a god watches over them. Since humans have industrialized and taken over many parts of the world, it would not surprise anyone if gods appeared in pieces of art, film, and literature, as in Stephen Leacock’s “Merry Christmas.” Within the story,  Father Time symbolizes the “God” that many religions worship, though one can only infer it from the text.

Throughout the short story, father time tells the protagonist of the story about the history of Christmas, and how the protagonist "[didn’t] know that there has always been Christmas” (Leacock). Father time at this point may as well serve as the concept that Leacock depicts as God, as father time has existed since the start of time; hence, one can construe his name to equate to the father of time. Many religions state that the universe and everything that we know of was created by the supreme deity, it would make sense that father time is the depiction of what god looks and acts like for Stephen Leacock. Furthermore, Father time tells the protagonist, “You seldom pass [100 years] nowadays, do you? Your life is very short of late” (Leacock). Father time is alluding to the war that is occuring, killing countless people around the world, bringing down the average lifespan.  The wry comment by father time accentuates his displeasure about the war that rages throughout Europe.

These days, Father Time could be seen as a manifestation of “God,” thus symbolizing him as such throughout “Merry Christmas” by Stephen Leacock. The actual existence of god remains debatable by some, but in the end, its existence does not matter as much as “god” serving as a figure for people to band together.
