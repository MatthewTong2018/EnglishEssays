Jen Selinsky once said, “Literacy is one of the greatest gifts a person could receive.” The ability to read allows a person to experience the stories or fantasies of others, and usually signifies the beginning and maturing of one’s mental capacity as the use and recognition of more descriptive words increases and spelling errors decrease. In “Flowers for Algernon '' by Daniel Keyes, the short story’s protagonist volunteers on a mental expedition to the peak of humanity’s mental abilities through medical treatments.  Charlie’s rise to personal glory through his complex narrative captures the heart and compels much compassion and sorrow from the reader, thus illustrating how the actual words and style the character uses evokes such strong emotions.

Many people suffer from possessiveness, or the inability or unwillingness to give up money, fame, reputation, loved ones, or even knowledge. Because of an attachment to the material world (like money, toys, clothing, friends, and family), those people will feel some level of grief when they lose what they have, especially when they worked hard to get it. When the protagonist of the story, Charlie Gordon, volunteers for a science experiment that would test if an operation has the potential to improve one’s intelligence. Keyes intentionally employs many spelling and grammatical errors at the beginning of the short story, indicating the level of intelligence that he possesses prior to the experiment. As Charlie recounts his experiences learning from Mrs Kinnian, the reader probably felt as if he was listening to a story told by a child with the unique ways he described the time he spends in the facility. 
As the story proceeds, Charlie eventually becomes more and more intelligent, and the reader can observe his self-correction with his spelling mistakes, his expansion and use of vocabulary, and punctuation, Keyes designates the reader as an informal guardian watching his child mentally develop. Eventually, Charlie becomes so intelligent that he becomes the envy of the doctor who performed the operation on him. Not everyone can pick up Chinese or Hindustani in such a short amount of time. 
At this point within the short story, the reader may feel nothing but appreciation, as Charlie was able to evolve from barely literate to fluent in numerous languages. Near the conclusion of the story, Charlie discovers after intensive research that the operation will eventually revert, turning him back to what he was before. 

As Charlie narrates his loss of his abilities, he realizes one day he will lose the basic ability to read or understand any of his notes. Such a decline garners much sympathy from an audience, as readers have also felt the pain and sorrow of losing something dear. The clever way that Keyes wrote “Flowers for Algernon” inherently builds a sense of attachment to Charlie, like the reader has a stake in his accomplishments, too. They, too, could imagine the pathos felt by Charlie as his world of higher awareness crashes down, like a brilliant professor who succumbs to dementia.
The stripping of Charlie’s abillities may relate to one’s life, where he might have lost friends, jobs, or certain skills. That relation that Keyes utilizes the emotions of the reader to bring about emotions for the character. In order to get the attention, or interest of people in life, one must appeal to their needs, tell them about how it will affect them, or utilize their feelings to trick them into feeling attached to what you are trying to convey.
